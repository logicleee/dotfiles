  ... use at your own risk ...

** ~dotfiles/templates/~
   This folder contiains what you would typically expect to see in your home folder as ~~/.<file or folder>~

** ~dotfiles/templates/bin/setup-dotfiles.sh~
   This script copies the ~templates/~ folder to ~local/~ and links each ~loca/file~ basically as ~~/.<file>~

* Installation
** Clone this repository
* Run ~dotfiles-setup.sh~
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    cd dotfiles && ./template/bin/dotfiles-setup.sh
   #+END_SRC
* Extending
  The ~dotfiles/local~ folder is in ~.gitignore~ :
  You can move it somewhere else (like Dropbox) or create a ~git submodule~ there.

* ~system-setup~
  Mostly for macOS, but room to add a Linux setup

* Run ~run_setup.sh~
  Installer will guide you through device profile selection and hostname setup.
  I took out steps setting up other users via ansible -- for macOS, it may be better to just do via GUI
